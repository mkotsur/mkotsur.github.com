This github/jekyll hybrid is my third attempt to have a blog.

The first one was real fun, it was a blog, hosted on virtual server powered by [Textpattern CMS](http://textpattern.com/). That was kind of interesting, I wrote few plugins, commited to existing ones, but once I started to understand how creepy PHP is, it started to become less and less fun to maintain that.

After that I got hooked up with blog-as-a-service [Posterous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous), which was first acquired by Twitter, and then shut down on Feb 2013.

Now this. Let's see how it goes
